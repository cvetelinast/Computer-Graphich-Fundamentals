# Computer-Graphich-Fundamentals
Project in Computer Graphich Fundamentals.
With made and given from our professor library human.js, my task was to represent action of 2 or more people.
I chose the topic "Dance," because in this aspect of life we want the perfect symmetry, and here it is supplied to us.
There is music file in the archive and the pictures work properly with the browser Mozilla Firefox.
